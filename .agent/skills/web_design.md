# Premium Web Design Skill

This skill focuses on delivering "WOW" factor designs using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. It emphasizes aesthetics, micro-animations, and premium feel.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Visual Excellence
- **Color Palettes:** Avoid generic colors. Use HSL-based harmonious schemes or sophisticated dark modes.
- **Typography:** Prioritize Google Fonts (Inter, Outfit, Playfair Display) with proper hierarchy and line-heights.
- **Surface & Depth:** Use glassmorphism (backdrop-blur), subtle border-gradients, and soft shadows (`shadow-xl`, `shadow-2xl`).

### 2. Interaction & Motion
- **Micro-animations:** Use Framer Motion for entrance animations, hover states, and layout transitions.
- **Feedback:** Every interaction (click, hover) must have a subtle, premium visual response.

### 3. Component Architecture
- **Shadcn/UI:** Leverage and customize shadcn/ui components for consistency.
- **Responsive Layouts:** Implement mobile-first, fluid containers (`max-w-7xl`, `mx-auto`, `px-4/6/8`).

## Capabilities

- **UI Mockup Generation:** Create detailed React/Tailwind code for premium sections (Hero, Features, Dashboard).
- **Design Review:** Analyze existing code and suggest "aesthetic upgrades" (e.g., adding gradients, fixing padding).
- **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensure high-contrast ratios and screen-reader compatibility without sacrificing style.

## Instructions for the Agent
1. When asked to "design" something, never provide a simple MVP. Always aim for a "premium-tier" look.
2. Use dynamic elements (e.g., `animate-pulse`, `bg-gradient-to-br`) where appropriate.
3. If an image is needed, use the `generate_image` tool to create high-quality assets.
4. Always check `index.css` or Tailwind config to ensure global styles are respected.
